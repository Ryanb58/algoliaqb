### Problem:

An app I have been working on has a few points of code duplication and increased complexity. This package is a way for me to fix those issues and increase readability.

### Installation

```
pip install algoliaqb
```

### Example:

```python
from algoliasearch.search_client import SearchClient
from algoliaqb import AlgoliaQueryBuilder
from flask import request


aqb = AlgoliaQueryBuilder(
    search_param="search",
    filter_map={
        "group_id": "tenant_id",
        "is_reported": "is_reported"
    }
)

# Extract the search query from our flask apps request.args var.
search_query = aqb.get_search_query(request.args)
# Get the filter query from our request args.
filter_query = aqb.get_filter_query(request.args)

# Now that we have the filter string, we just pass it into the search function.

search_client = SearchClient()
index = search_client.init_index("contacts")
results = index.search(search_query, {"filters": filter_query})
```
